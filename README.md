# Tour of Heroes

## Story

You build your own app from the ground up, providing experience with the typical development process, as well as an introduction to basic app-design concepts, tools, and terminology.

This Tour of Heroes tutorial shows you how to set up your local development environment and develop an app using the Angular CLI tool, and provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular.

The Tour of Heroes app that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The app has many of the features you'd expect to find in any data-driven application. The finished app acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

You'll learn enough Angular to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do.

You can see how this app will look at the end of you developing and learning way - [live example](https://run.stackblitz.com/api/angular/v1?file=src/app/hero.service.ts).

    - Create project - repository is empty for the purpose of setting up Angular app from the beginning.
    - Follow each steps from the [Tour of Heroes app and tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial).
    - It's highly recommended to not copy introduced steps line to line. Based on the tutorial documentation you can present your own topic, so instead of Heroes, you can make e.g. Pokemon app, or something about flower, animals.
